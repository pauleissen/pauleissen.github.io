In my humble opinion,
Kernighan and Pike's
<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/" target="_blank">
<i>The Practice of Programming</i></a> <a href="#1">[1]</a>
is a book every programmer should read
(and not just because I'm a fan of all things C and UNIX).
A few years ago I was reading Chapter 3,
<i>Design and Implementation</i>,
whichs examines how programming problems influence the way
data structures are used, and recognizes that
&ldquo;[p]rogram design can certainly be colored by a language
but is not usually dominated by it." <a href="#2">[2]</a>
To put some (virtual) flesh on these assertions,
the authors chose to implement the <i>Markov chain algorithm</i>
in five programming languages
(C, Java, C++, Awk, and Perl). <a href="#3">[3]</a>
</p>

<p id="ref4">
This particular Markov chain algorithm reads English text and generates
(sometimes humorous) output that resembles English.
Input text is broken up into three-word tuples consisting of
a two-word <i>prefix</i> (<i>w1</i> and <i>w2</i> shown below)
followed by a single <i>suffix</i> word
(<i>w3</i>):
<pre>
set w1 and w2 to the first two words
    in the text
print w1 and w2
loop:
    randomly choose w3, one of the
        successors of prefix w1 w2
        in the text
    print w3
    replace w1 and w2 by w2 and w3
    repeat loop <a href="#4">[4]</a>
</pre>
</p>
(Obviously, the last two words in the input will not have a suffix.)
A <i>word</i> consists of all non-whitespace characters (including leading
and/or trailing punctuation) contained between
whitespace and/or EOF.
</p>

<p id="ref5">
For instance, given this input text: <a href="#5">[5]</a>
<blockquote>
Show your flowcharts and conceal your tables and I will be mystified.
Show your tables and your flowcharts will be obvious.
</blockquote>
the algorithm will
discover the following prefixes (left column) and suffixes
(right column):
<pre>
Show your       flowcharts tables
your flowcharts and will
flowcharts and  conceal
and conceal     your
conceal your    tables
your tables     and and
tables and      I your
and I           will
I will          be
will be         mystified. obvious.
be mystified.   Show
mystified Show  your
and your        flowcharts
flowcharts will be
be obvious.     EOF
</pre>
and then print the first prefix &ldquo;Show your", randomly select, say,
&ldquo;tables", print this word,
create a new prefix &ldquo;your tables",
and so on until the final prefix, &ldquo;be obvious." is reached
(and printed).
</p>

<p>
At the time, I knew enough
<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>
to be dangerous,
so I decided to implement the Markov chain algorithm in this
scripting language (in particular, Python 2.7).
The rest of the article explains what I came up with and why.
</p>

<p class="heading">
Source Code
</p>

<p id="ref6">
Not surprisingly,
my implementation <a href="#6">[6]</a>
resembles the ones found in the book,
although the Python-isms made it more streamlined.
The code presented in the following sections
are not necessarily in the order required by Python;
I chose this method for pedagogical reasons.
</p>

<p>
<i>First Things</i>
</p>

<p>
The
<i>markov-tpop.py</i>
script requires the services of the following standard Python modules:
<pre>
import sys
import random
import string
</pre>
</p>

<p id="ref7">
Next, two global variables are defined:
<pre>
NPREF = 2
NONWORD = '\n'
</pre>
A prefix consists of two words,
because for English at least, &ldquo;using two words to select
a third is a good compromise: it seems to recreate the flavor
of the input while adding its own whimsical touch." <a href="#7">[7]</a>
</p>

<p id="ref8-10">
We also define a variable that represents a non-word,
something that is <i>not</i> seen by the input text processing code.
In addition to acting as a &ldquo;marker word to terminate
the algorithm," <a href="#8">[8]</a>
this variable plays the part of a <i>sentinal</i> value,
in that the programmatic appending of a non-word to the input data
&ldquo;simplifies the main processing loops of the program
significantly." <a href="#9">[9]</a>
Finally, to handle the case of insufficient input (e.g.,
a file consisting of a single word) without the use of ugly special-case
code, prior to reading the input, a prefix consisting of two non-words
is constructed,
&ldquo;which guarantees there is always enough input for the program...
This has the nice benefit that the first word of the input file
will be the first <i>suffix</i> of the fake prefix, so the generation
loop needs to print only the suffixes it produces." <a href="#10">[10]</a>
</p>

<p>
<i>Data Structures</i>
</p>

<p>
In their C implementation, the authors had to create their own
data structures
(linked lists, hash tables, etc.) by hand, but Python's native
<i>lists</i> and <i>dictionaries</i> seem almost
tailor-made for programs like ours.
We merely have to define a single empty dictionary:
<pre>
statetab = {}
</pre>
</p>

<p id="ref11">
A prefix and all of its possible suffixes is known as a <i>state</i>,
&ldquo;which is standard terminology
for Markov algorithms," <a href="#11">[11]</a>
hence the name of this global variable.
In our script,
a prefix is a Python list that serves as a <i>key</i>
to look up in <i>statetab</i> the
corresponding suffix(es), which reside in a separate list.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Driver</i>
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;main" function looks like this:
<pre>
if __name__ == '__main__':
    MAXGEN = 10000

    prefix = []

    for i in range(NPREF):
        prefix.append(NONWORD)

    build(prefix)
    add(prefix, NONWORD)

    generate(MAXGEN)

    sys.exit(0)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
(Note the lack of special-purpose code to catch edge cases.
Our script can handle empty input files, files with a single word,
and files with two words.)
The initial prefix is constructed, which is then used to kick off
input file processing.
A non-word is made the synthetic suffix for the last prefix
prior to generating
the output text.
For grins, we limit the program output to 10,000 generated words.
</p>

<p>
<i>Processing Input</i>
</p>

<p>
The work of processing the input file
is divided between two functions.
The simplest way to obtain input data is to force the user
to provide the contents of a file to <i>stdin</i>.
(On the Unix command line, this may be accomplished
by <i>cat</i>-ing a text file and then
piping the output to our Python script.)
<pre>
def build(prefix):
    for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
        if len(line.strip(
                string.whitespace)) == 0:
            continue
        for word in line.split():
            add(prefix, word)
            prefix.pop(0)
            prefix.append(word)
    return
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Each input line is broken up into zero or more words (as defined above).
We skip lines that have no words.
Otherwise, each word encountered is associated with the current prefix.
Do not miss the fact
that every time <i>build()</i> is called, <i>prefix</i>
is modified (think &ldquo;call by reference") for use by the
subsequent <i>build()</i> invocation.
</p>

<p>
If <i>word</i> is the first suffix encountered by <i>prefix</i>,
we &ldquo;create" a new <i>statetab</i> record,
otherwise the new suffix is appended to the existing list.
Note that duplicate suffixes are legal.
Python does not allow <i>mutable</i> objects like lists to serve
as dictionary keys, so we have to employ immutable tuples.
<pre>
def add(prefix, word):
    key = tuple(prefix)
    if key in statetab:
        statetab[key].append(word)
    else:
        statetab[key] = [word]
    return
</pre>
(In their various implementations,
Kernighan and Pike modify <i>prefix</i> in <i>add()</i>, but we decided
to edit that parameter in <i>build()</i> instead, since the final call
to <i>add()</i> in <i>build()</i> has no need to modify <i>prefix</i>.)
</p>

<p>
If we were to execute <i>print prefix, statetab[prefix]</i>
before the <i>return</i> statement in <i>add()</i>,
the following diagnostic output will be produced
given our sample
input sentence:
<pre>
['\n', '\n'] ['Show']
['\n', 'Show'] ['your']
['Show', 'your'] ['flowcharts']
['your', 'flowcharts'] ['and']
['flowcharts', 'and'] ['conceal']
['and', 'conceal'] ['your']
['conceal', 'your'] ['tables']
['your', 'tables'] ['and']
['tables', 'and'] ['I']
['and', 'I'] ['will']
['I', 'will'] ['be']
['will', 'be'] ['mystified.']
['be', 'mystified.'] ['Show']
['mystified.', 'Show'] ['your']
['Show', 'your'] ['flowcharts', 'tables']
['your', 'tables'] ['and', 'and']
['tables', 'and'] ['I', 'your']
['and', 'your'] ['flowcharts']
['your', 'flowcharts'] ['and', 'will']
['flowcharts', 'will'] ['be']
['will', 'be'] ['mystified.', 'obvious.']
['be', 'obvious.'] ['\n']
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<i>Generating Output</i>
</p>

<p>
In the diagnostic output, the first record in <i>statetab</i>
consists of two non-words with a single suffix that happens to be the
first input word, and the second record contains the second input word.
This is an ingenious method on the authors' part for arranging the
printing of the first input prefix without the use of special-purpose
code.
<pre>
def generate(nwords):
    prefix = []

    for i in range(NPREF):
        prefix.append(NONWORD)

    random.seed()

    for i in range(nwords):
        suffixes = statetab[tuple(prefix)]
        word = random.choice(suffixes)
        if word == NONWORD:
            break
        print word,
        prefix.pop(0)
        prefix.append(word)

    return
</pre>
</p>

<p id="ref12">
The <i>random</i> Python module does a passable job of enabling
<i>generate()</i>
to choose
one of the suffixes from the list.
The comma in the <i>print</i> statement
&ldquo;suppresses the end-of-line character
normally added at the end of the printed text." <a href="#12">[12]</a>
In practice, <i>word</i> is printed along with a single space character,
except for the last word to be printed, which is followed by a non-word,
the &lsquo;\n' character,
which just so happens to be the
&ldquo;suffix" associated with the final prefix,
one reason why the main driver makes that call to <i>add()</i>.
The other reason is that processing will halt if this suffix
is encountered before <i>nwords</i> have been printed.
</p>

<p>
So our original sample input:
<blockquote>
Show your flowcharts and conceal your
tables and I will be mystified.
Show your tables and your flowcharts
will be obvious.
</blockquote>
may be rewritten many different ways:
<pre>
$ ./markov-tpop.py < brooks.txt | fmt -w 40
Show your flowcharts will be obvious.

$ ./markov-tpop.py < brooks.txt | fmt -w 40
Show your flowcharts and conceal your
tables and I will be mystified. Show
your tables and I will be obvious.

$ ./markov-tpop.py < brooks.txt | fmt -w 40
Show your tables and your flowcharts
and conceal your tables and your
flowcharts will be obvious.
</pre>
</p>

Fun Example
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm#link2HCH0001" target="_blank">
Chapter 1</a>
of Jane Austin's
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
opens with this famous sentence (you may have to click twice on the link to get the actual text):
<blockquote>
It is a truth universally acknowledged,
that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
</blockquote>
and ends like this:
<blockquote>
The business of her life was to get her daughters married;
its solace was visiting and news.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
When we ran our script against Chapter 1, the following was generated:
<!--
                                   ^
-->
<pre>
$ ./markov-tpop.py < pridech1.txt | fmt -w 40
It is a truth universally acknowledged,
that a single man in possession of a
wife. However little known the feelings
or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this
truth is so well fixed in the minds of
the surrounding families, that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas,
and some of his servants are to be
sure! A single man in possession
of a wife. However little known the
feelings or views of such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no
compassion for my little Lizzy.” “I
desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy
is not a bit better than the others;
and I am thinking of her life was to
get her daughters married; its solace
was visiting and news.
