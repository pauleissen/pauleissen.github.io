In late May 2023 the Wall Street Journal published a
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-soldiers-truth-review-ernie-pyle-at-the-front-7e9bd3bd?page=1" target="_blank">book review</a>
of David Chrisinger's
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/635246/the-soldiers-truth-by-david-chrisinger/" target="_blank">
<i>The Soldier's Truth: Ernie Pyle and the Story of World War II</i></a>.
I knew that Ernie Pyle was a famous war correspondent, but I didn't
realize he walked up and down Normandy Beach on
7 June 1944, the day after D-Day.
The review included several
quotes from Pyle's book <i>Brave Men</i>, originally published
in 1944 and reissued in 2001 and 2023.<a href="#1">[1]</a>
</p>

<p id="ref2">
I wanted to read Pyle's Normandy experiences for myself, so I created an
account at the Internet Archive's
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/" target="_blank">Open Library</a>
and found and "checked out" an
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6795922M/Brave_men" target="_blank">
online copy</a>
of his book.<a href="#2">[2]</a>.
On page 390 he wrote:
<blockquote>
I took a walk along the historic coast of Normandy in the country of France.
It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore.
Men were sleeping on the sand, some of them sleeping forever.
Men were floating in the water, for they were dead.
...
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
I walked for a mile and a half along the water's edge of our many miled
invasion beach.
I walked slowly, for the detail of that beach was infinite.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The wreckage was vast and startling. The awful waste and destruction
of war, even aside from the loss of human life, has always been one
of its outstanding features to those who are in it. Anything and
everything is expendable. And we did expend on our beachhead in
Normandy during those first few hours.
</blockquote>

It was a lovely day
on 4 June 1979
when I took this photograph on
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Omaha+Beach/@49.3673381,-0.877163,4282m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x480b08081a97b07b:0x652b44ab64e81d92!8m2!3d49.3696815!4d-0.8710842!16zL20vMGdjNm4?entry=ttu" target="_blank">Omaha Beach</a>
near the village of Vierville-sur-Mer.
I probably strolled on the same patch of sand as Pyle did 35 years earlier,
but thankfully I didn't see any signs of a great battle,
save for
destroyed inland bunkers and the remains of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_hedgehog" target="_blank">
Czech hedgehogs</a> that were barely visible at low tide.

After all these years,
I still can't fathom what happened there on 6 June 1944.
