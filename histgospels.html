The two-fold purpose of the first edition of Craig Blomberg's
<i>The Historical Reliability of the Gospels</i> <a href="#1">[1]</a>
is to &ldquo;provide answers to questions of historicity
which will stand up to serious academic scrutiny
and ... provide some help for those who are
perplexed by scholarly disagreement" (p. xii).
Blomberg's book
describes the academic debates concerning
the gospel record and seeks to present the
&ldquo;substantial body of literature which supports
the historicity of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John" (p. 258).
He does not assume the gospels are unreliable
by definition (the majority report among critical
biblical scholars) and then tries to prove them
reliable, nor does he automatically subscribe
to the well-known C.S. Lewis apologetic of
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6979-i-am-trying-here-to-prevent-anyone-saying-the-really" target="_blank">
&ldquo;liar, lunatic, or Lord"</a>
and assumes the gospel
record is accurate by definition.
Instead, using the tools of academic historical
research, the author examines the gospels and comes
to the conclusion that they faithfully record the
life and deeds of Jesus.
Blomberg
commends to the
critical scholarly community the reliability
of the gospel tradition,
and in so doing,
extends Jesus' &ldquo;invitation to discipleship"
to those within the ivory tower.
</p>

<p>
Blomberg begins by explaining the &ldquo;traditional"
view of the historicity of the gospels, which
were considered reliable precisely because
the Scriptures were assumed to be inspired and
infallible.
The author notes that some of the early church fathers
recognized the theological emphases of the evangelists,
believed the gospel accounts were extracted from larger sources,
and noticed the general lack of interest in chronology of the
part of the evangelists (ideas &ldquo;rediscovered" centuries
later by critical scholars).
Blomberg discusses the &ldquo;Synoptic problem" and believes
the three gospel writers depended on 
Mark, &ldquo;Q", and extra-biblical oral and written sources.
Apparent contradictions among
the Synoptics are examined, and Blomberg argues
that many of the variations
&ldquo;are no greater, and often much more trivial, than those which
characterize any two independent historical accounts of the
same events" (p. 114).
The case for the reliability of the
Synoptics cannot automatically apply to the Gospel of John
because of the latter's distinctiveness, but Blomberg
ultimately concludes that John
records accurate information about Jesus' life.
He denies that &ldquo;modern" approaches to gospel
research (form, redaction, midrash, and reader-response criticism;
the &ldquo;new hermeneutic")
have overthrown
our traditional confidence in the reliability of the gospels,
refuting the scientific,
philosophical, and historical objections to the miracle accounts
in the gospels, and
tackling objections to the greatest miracle of all,
arguing that if the Resurrection is historical, then the other
miracles performed by Jesus must also be considered authentic.

<p id="ref2">
Blomberg states in another essay, &ldquo;[d]espite widespread skepticism
in radical biblical criticism, a powerful case can be mounted
for the general historical trustworthiness of the Synoptic Gospels,
when measured by the standards of accurate history writing
of <i>their</i> day, even when one does not begin by presupposing
some theory of inspiration or inerrancy." <a href="#2">[2]</a>
He approves of the approach taken by the eighteenth
century German theologian J.D. Michaelis, who rejected the
traditional definition of the canon as his starting point and
maintained one could demonstrate in a purely historical manner
the trustworthiness of the gospels (p. 6).
Blomberg appeals to the evidentialist position when he states
that &ldquo;an <i>a priori</i> rejection of the inspiration of Scripture
is a valid approach even for commentators who believe in that
doctrine" (p. 9).
This is the major weakness in Blomberg's book,
his refusal to assume the doctrine of the infallibility
of Scripture when applying the &ldquo;standard methods of historical
enquiry" (p. 256) to argue for the reliability of the gospels.
He maintains that the writer of the
Gospel of John &ldquo;believed that the Spirit had superintended the
process by which the traditions of Jesus and the memories of
the eyewitnesses of his life were preserved so as to safeguard
their accuracy," (p. 184)
but
does not appear give the Spirit the credit He deserves,
insisting that &ldquo;even if a few contradictions
genuinely existed, this would not necessarily jeopardize
the reliability of the rest of call into question the entire
basis for belief" (p. 11, <i>cf.</i> p. 152).
In his discussion of gospel genres, Blomberg again
states that
<blockquote>
even if some of the apparent contradictions proved
to be genuine this would not necessarily discredit the rest
of the narratives.
The view held by some Bible students that admission of one
error in a book makes all the rest of it equally suspect
presupposes a method which no reputable historian would
adopt (p. 236).
</blockquote>
But God is no mere historian - He is truth Incarnate.
